Build a modern, professional static website for AustinTablesAndChairs.com, hosted on Cloudflare Pages free tier. The site is an unbiased renter’s guide to event rentals in the Austin, Texas area. Its purpose is to help people understand the event rental process, what’s fair to pay, how to compare companies, and what equipment they might need — without sales pitches.
The design should look like it was created in 2025: clean, modern, mobile-friendly, with a professional but welcoming feel (similar to Wirecutter or Consumer Reports in tone).
The website must prioritize E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). Make it clear that all recommendations are unbiased and unsponsored.
Technical Requirements
Must be a static site (no databases).


Should use a framework that works with Cloudflare Pages (Astro, Hugo, or Next.js in static export mode).


Content sections should be easy to expand later (blog posts, guides, etc.), ideally in Markdown or MDX.


The website should be highly optimized for SEO.  This is the 1 priority.  Include basic SEO optimization (semantic HTML, descriptive meta tags, headings, alt text) plus add any other more advanced SEO techniques that can help the website gain a high SEO rating.


Use structured data schema (FAQ schema, How-To schema) where applicable.
